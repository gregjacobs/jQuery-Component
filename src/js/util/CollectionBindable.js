	 * @class jqc.util.CollectionBindable
	 * @extends Object
	 * 
	 * This class is intended to be used as a mixin. It allows any class that it is mixed into (the "target" class in these docs) to have 
	 * a {@link data.Collection} bound to it by providing the common functionality to allow a collection's events to be listened to and handled.
	 * These same event listeners are also removed when the collection is unbound, and the class provides the functionality to make sure that
	 * the same collection isn't bound over itself.
	 * 
	 * This mixin provides the basic method to {@link #bindCollection bind a collection}, which automatically unbinds any previously-bound 
	 * {@link data.Collection Collection} in the process. Classes using this mixin should implement the {@link #getCollectionListeners} method, 
	 * to specify which listeners should automatically be attached when a collection is bound, and unattached when the collection is unbound.
	 * 
	 * The target class may also implement the {@link #onCollectionBind} method, to detect and handle when a new {@link data.Collection} has
	 * been bound, and/or when the currently-bound collection has been unbound.
	 * 
	 * Here is an example of mixing this class into a {@link jqc.Component Component}, to make the Component data-bound to a Collection:
	 * 
	 *     define( [
	 *         'jqc/Component',
	 *         'jqc/util/CollectionBindable'
	 *     ], function( Component, CollectionBindable ) {
	 *         
	 *         var MyBindableComponent = Component.extend( {
	 *             mixins : [ CollectionBindable ],
	 *             
	 *             
	 *             initComponent : function() {
	 *                 this._super( arguments );
	 *                 
	 *                 // Call CollectionBindable's constructor, in the scope of this object.
	 *                 // Even though there is no implementation in the CollectionBindable constructor 
	 *                 // at this time, it is a good idea in case an implementation is added in the future.
	 *                 CollectionBindable.call( this );
	 *             }
	 *             
	 *             // ...
	 *             
	 *             
	 *             // Specifies the listeners that will be added to the collection
	 *             getCollectionListeners : function( collection ) {
	 *                 return {
	 *                     'load'   : this.onLoad,          // listen to `load` and `change`
	 *                     'change' : this.onModelChange,   // events of the bound collection
	 *                     scope    : this
	 *                 };
	 *             },

	 *                 // handle the collection's `load` event here
	 *             },
	 *             
	 *             onModelChange : function( collection ) {
	 *                 // handle a model in the bound collection changing here
	 *             },
	 *             
	 *             
	 *             // ...
	 *
