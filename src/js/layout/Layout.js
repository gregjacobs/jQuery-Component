	 * @abstract 
	 * @class gui.layout.Layout
	 * @extends Observable
	 * 
	 * Base class Layout that defines the public interface of all Layout subclasses. Layouts are stateful strategy objects 
	 * that are used by {@link gui.Container gui.Containers} to implement how their child items are displayed. Because of their 
	 * stateful nature, the same layout may not be used by multiple {@link gui.Container gui.Containers}.
	 * 
	 * The default layout that is used for a {@link gui.Container Container} is the {@link gui.layout.Auto}, 
	 * which simply renders each child component directly into the {@link gui.Container gui.Container's} 
	 * {@link gui.Container#getLayoutTarget layout target element}, and does no further sizing or formatting.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Building a Layout
	 * 
	 * Layout subclasses should implement the {@link #onLayout} hook method to implement their layout routine.
	 * They should first call the superclass `onLayout` method, and then implement the code to perform the desired layout.
	 * Note the following items:
	 * 
	 * - {@link #onLayout} and {@link #afterLayout} will be executed each time the {@link #container container's} 
	 *   {@link gui.Container#doLayout} method is executed. This means that {@link #onLayout} and {@link #afterLayout}
	 *   may be called multiple times during the lifetime of the Layout, and this should be handled. Some layouts choose
	 *   to have completely separate "first run" and "update layout" methods.
	 * - Use the helper methods in this Layout class to {@link #renderComponent render} and {link #sizeComponent size}
	 *   child components of the {@link #container}. They take into account details of the Layout system, and sizing details
	 *   (such as accounting for child component padding/margin/border) that aren't handled elsewhere. See the 
	 *   {@link #renderComponent} and {@link #sizeComponent} methods for details.
	 * - Layouts should handle the case of the {@link #container} they are laying out having 0 child components, and it should
	 *   also handle the cases where child components are added, removed, or reordered. However, try not execute the
	 *   {@link #renderComponent} method (and thus the {@link gui.Component#method-render} method) when the component is already
	 *   rendered and in the correct position. This adds DOM overhead, and can cause some weird behavior such as having
	 *   {@link gui.form.field.Text Text Fields} to lose focus if a layout runs that does this.
	 * - Browser window resize events should not be handled within the Layout. The top level {@link gui.Viewport} will
	 *   call its {@link gui.Container#doLayout doLayout} method to fix the layout automatically, on resize.
	 * 
	 * Layouts are required to manage any HTML elements that they create, and should clean up after themselves
	 * when they are done. This includes cleaning up old HTML elements when {@link #doLayout} (and therefore,
	 * {@link #onLayout}) is run again, and when the Layout is {@link #method-destroy destroyed}. Subclasses should
	 * implement the {@link #onDestroy} method to implement their clean up as part of the destruction process.
	 * Note that a layout may be destroyed by a {@link gui.Container} if another layout is set to it, and therefore
	 * it cannot be relied on that the Container will clean up any stray elements that a Layout has created.

		 * Utility method used to render a child {@link gui.Component} into the layout's target element. This method renders

		 * 
		 * This method lazily renders the provided `component`. A call to the component's {@link gui.Component#method-render render}
		 * method will only be made if:
		 * 
		 * 1) The `component` is not yet {@link gui.Component#method-render rendered}.
		 * 2) The `component` is rendered, but not a child of the `$targetEl`. Calling {@link gui.Component#method-render render} here
		 *    will move it.
		 * 3) The `component` is not at the provided `position` in the $targetEl. Basically if the `position` option is provided,

		 *    {@link gui.Component#method-render render} will be made.

		 * doing so is so that we do not end up moving components around the DOM when they don't need to be. Doing so will
		 * make the browser do more work, and can also cause unwanted side effects. One of these side effects could be if the user 
		 * is editing a {@link gui.form.field.TextArea TextArea Field}, and the field resizes, triggering a layout routine 
		 * (see {@link gui.form.field.TextArea#autoGrow}). If a parent layout of the TextArea moves a component in the DOM, 
		 * the TextArea will lose focus, and the user would have to click into it again to continue editing.

		 *   by this method (if provided), to determine if the `component` needs to be moved (by way

		 *   the component is already in the correct position, or else no call to {@link gui.Component#method-render}
