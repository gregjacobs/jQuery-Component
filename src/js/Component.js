	/**
	 * @class gui.Component
	 * @extends Observable
	 * @alias type.component
	 * 
	 * Generalized component that defines a displayable item that can be placed onto a page. This class is the base class of all components in
	 * the library.
	 * 
	 * The Component class provides a base HTML element (by default, a &lt;div&gt;), and a framework for the instantiation, rendering, and (eventually) 
	 * destruction of the component, with events that can be listened to each step of the way.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Lazy Instantiation
	 * 
	 * Components can be constructed via anonymous config objects, based on their `type` property. This is useful for defining components in
	 * an anonymous object, when added as items of a {@link gui.Container}. For example:
	 * 
	 *     @example
	 *     require( [
	 *         'gui/Container',
	 *         'gui/Component'
	 *     ], function( Container ) {
	 *     
	 *         var container = new Container( {
	 *             renderTo : 'body',
	 *             
	 *             items : [
	 *                 { type: 'component', html: "Component1" },
	 *                 { type: 'component', html: "Component2" }
	 *             ]
	 *         } );
	 *     
	 *     } );
	 * 
	 * Other components from the library may be added as well. See each component's "type" property in the docs.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Unrendered vs. Rendered State
	 * 
	 * When a Component is first instantiated, it is "unrendered." This means that no HTML elements have been created for it yet. Only when
	 * the {@link #method-render} method is executed will any HTML elements be generated.
	 * 
	 * For example:
	 * 
	 *     // Instantiate a new component
	 *     var component = new Component( { id: 'myComponent', html: '<span class="test-component">Test Component</span>' } );  // this HTML is *not* yet rendered to the page
	 *     
	 *     // Now render the component to the document body
	 *     component.render( 'body' );  // the HTML is generated, and appended to the document body
	 * 
	 * The component's {@link #$el element} will not exist until the component has been rendered.
	 * 
	 * This is an important distinction for when building components, in that methods that operate on a Component's DOM should properly handle 
	 * both an unrendered and rendered state. For example, assume one is building a simple TextField component:
	 * 
	 *     require( [
	 *         'gui/Component'
	 *     ], function( Component ) {
	 *     
	 *         // TextField class
	 *         var TextField = Component.extend( {
	 *             value : "",  // a configuration option
	 *         
	 *             renderTpl : '<input type="text" value="<%= component.value %>">',
	 *             
	 *             onRender : function() {
	 *                 this._super( arguments );
	 *                 
	 *                 this.$inputEl = this.$el.find( 'input' );  // store a reference to the input field when rendered
	 *             },
	 *             
	 *             // This method must check the rendered/unrendered state, in case it is called 
	 *             // before the Component is actually rendered anywhere
	 *             setValue : function( newValue ) {
	 *                 if( !this.isRendered() ) {
	 *                     this.value = newValue;          // Component not yet rendered, store the value for when it is
	 *                 } else {
	 *                     this.$inputEl.val( newValue );  // Component already rendered, update the HTML element directly
	 *                 }
	 *             }
	 *         } );
	 *         
	 *         
	 *         // Usage
	 *         var textField = new TextField( { value: "value1" } );
	 *         textField.setValue( "value2" );
	 *         
	 *         textField.render( 'body' );       // the TextField will render with the value "value2"
	 *         
	 *         textField.setValue( "value3" );   // the TextField will now show the value "value3"
	 *     } );
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The unrendered state of a Component allows for lazy rendering (i.e. rendering only when needed). This may be the case, for example, if
	 * a component exists within a {@link gui.tab.Panel TabPanel}. There is no reason to have the browser perform the extra work necessary to 
	 * render the components of a tab which hasn't been clicked on yet, so these components are left in their unrendered state until that time. 
	 * 
	 * These instantiated but unrendered components may still be updated by a {@link gui.app.Controller Controller} however. The client code 
	 * in the Controller should not have to first test if the component is rendered before calling methods on it, so the automatic handling 
	 * of rendered/unrendered state within the components makes this distinction transparent.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Other notes
	 * 
	 * Some other things to note about Component and its subclasses are:
	 * 
	 * - Any configuration options that are provided to its constructor are automatically applied (copied) onto the new Component object. This
	 *   makes them available as properties, and allows them to be referenced in subclasses as `this.configName`.  However, unless the
	 *   configuration options are also listed as public properties, they should not be used externally.
	 * - Components directly support masking and un-masking their viewable area.  See the {@link #maskConfig} configuration option, and the {@link #mask} and
	 *   {@link #unMask} methods.
	 * - When a Component is {@link #method-destroy} destroyed, a number of automatic cleanup mechanisms are executed. See {@link #method-destroy} for details.

		 * 
		 * ## Details
		 * 
		 * The markup generated by this template (in conjunction with the {@link #renderTplData} config) will be created during the

		 * If a subclass is supplying this config, it should also override the {@link #getContentTarget} method, and return the element
		 * that should be the target of the {@link #html}, {@link #contentEl}, and {@link #tpl} configs. For example:
		 * 
		 *     renderTpl : new LoDashTpl( [
		 *         '<div id="<%= elId %>-titlebar">',  // `elId` var is automatically provided in the {@link #renderTplData}, from the unique {@link #elId} property - See {@link #renderTplData}
		 *             '<%= title %>',                 // `title` var would need to be provided in the {@link #renderTplData} by subclass
		 *         '</div>',
		 *         '<div id="<%= elId %>-body"></div>'
		 *     ] ),
		 *     
		 *     getContentTarget : function() {
		 *         return this.bodyEl || (this.bodyEl = jQuery( '#' + this.elId + '-body' ));  // cache the bodyEl for subsequent calls
		 *     }
		 * 
		 * If, for example, the {@link #html} config is provided, then the value of the config will be placed into the "body" div.
		 * 
		 * ## Forms
		 * 
		 * This config may be a string, an array of strings, a compiled Lo-Dash template function, or a {@link gui.template.Template} 
		 * instance. For the string, array of strings, or function form, a {@link gui.template.LoDash LoDash template} instance will be 
		 * created when the Component is rendered. To use another Template type, pass in an instance of a {@link gui.template.Template} 
		 * subclass to this config.

		 * 
		 * However, at the time of this writing, we never got around to implementing this feature, and {@link gui.Container} extends
		 * this method for its {@link gui.Container#layout layout} of {@link gui.Container#items child components}. This method was added into 
		 * the Component class (this class) later though, in an effort to allow Components to respond to being laid out by their {@link #parentContainer}.
		 * When the Component's {@link #parentContainer} runs its {@link gui.Container#layout layout}, this method is executed from it. A 
		 * Component author may implement an extension of the {@link #onComponentLayout} hook method to respond to the Component being laid 
		 * out by its {@link #parentContainer}, such as to implement updating the size or positioning of its child elements upon being laid out.
		 * Note that {@link #onComponentLayout} will eventually be called just from the Component's initial {@link #method-render rendering} 
		 * process as well, if the Component is not being rendered by a {@link #parentContainer} layout (i.e. it is a standalone Component,
		 * not part of a {@link gui.Container Container}/Component hierarchy).
		 * 
		 * So, bottom line, if you wish for your Component to do something when it is laid out by its {@link #parentContainer},
		 * implement the {@link #onComponentLayout} method. See {@link #onComponentLayout} for details.
