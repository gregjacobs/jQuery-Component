	 * @class ui.Component
	 * @extends Observable
	 * 
	 * Generalized component that defines a displayable item that can be placed onto a page. Provides a base element (by default, a div),
	 * and a framework for the instantiation, rendering, and (eventually) the destruction process, with events that can be listened to
	 * each step of the way.
	 * 
	 * Components can be constructed via anonymous config objects, based on their `type` property. This is useful for defining components in
	 * an anonymous object, when added as items of a {@link ui.Container}.
	 * 
	 * Some other things to note about Component and its subclasses are:
	 * 
	 * - Any configuration options that are provided to its constructor are automatically applied (copied) onto the new Component object. This
	 *   makes them available as properties, and allows them to be referenced in subclasses as `this.configName`.  However, unless the
	 *   configuration options are also listed as public properties, they should not be used externally.
	 * - Components directly support masking and un-masking their viewable area.  See the {@link #maskConfig} configuration option, and the {@link #mask} and
	 *   {@link #unMask} methods.
	 * - When a Component is {@link #method-destroy} destroyed, a number of automatic cleanup mechanisms are executed. See {@link #method-destroy} for details.

		 * 
		 * If a subclass is supplying this config, it should also override the {@link #getContentTarget} method, and return the element
		 * that should be the target of the {@link #html}, {@link #contentEl}, and {@link #tpl} configs. For example:

		 * 
		 * If, for example, the {@link #html} config is provided, then the value of the config will be placed into the "body" div.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * This config may be a string, an array of strings, a compiled Lo-Dash template function, or a {@link ui.template.Template} 
		 * instance. For the string, array of strings, or function form, a {@link ui.template.LoDash LoDash template} instance will be

		 * 
		 * However, at the time of this writing, we never got around to implementing this feature, and {@link ui.Container} extends
		 * this method for its {@link ui.Container#layout layout} of {@link ui.Container#items child components}. This method was added into 
		 * the Component class (this class) later though, in an effort to allow Components to respond to being laid out by their {@link #parentContainer}.
		 * When the Component's {@link #parentContainer} runs its {@link ui.Container#layout layout}, this method is executed from it. A 
		 * Component author may implement an extension of the {@link #onComponentLayout} hook method to respond to the Component being laid 
		 * out by its {@link #parentContainer}, such as to implement updating the size or positioning of its child elements upon being laid out.
		 * Note that {@link #onComponentLayout} will eventually be called just from the Component's initial {@link #method-render rendering} 
		 * process as well, if the Component is not being rendered by a {@link #parentContainer} layout (i.e. it is a standalone Component,
		 * not part of a {@link ui.Container Container}/Component hierarchy).
		 * 
		 * So, bottom line, if you wish for your Component to do something when it is laid out by its {@link #parentContainer},
		 * implement the {@link #onComponentLayout} method. See {@link #onComponentLayout} for details.
