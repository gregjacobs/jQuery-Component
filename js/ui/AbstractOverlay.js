	 * 
	 * @cfg {String} anchor.my
	 *   Where on the overlay itself to position against the target `element`. Accepts a string in the
	 *   form of "horizontal vertical". A single value such as "right" will default to "right center", "top" 
	 *   will default to "center top" (following CSS convention). Acceptable values: "top", "center", "bottom",
	 *   "left", "right". Example: "left top" or "center center".  So, if "left top", the top left of the overlay
	 *   will be positioned to the target `element`. Defaults to "left top".
	 * 
	 * @cfg {String} anchor.at
	 *   Where at the target `element` the overlay should be positioned against. Accepts a string in the
	 *   form of "horizontal vertical". A single value such as "right" will default to "right center", "top" 
	 *   will default to "center top" (following CSS convention). Acceptable values: "top", "center", "bottom",
	 *   "left", "right". Example: "left top" or "center center".  So, if "left bottom", the overlay will be
	 *   positioned against the bottom left of the target `element`. Defaults to "left bottom".
	 * 
	 * @cfg {HTMLElement/jQuery/ui.Component} anchor.of
	 *   The HTMLElement or {@link ui.Component} to anchor the overlay to. Can either be defined as either "of" (following 
	 *   jQuery UI) or "element". Required unless the `element` property is provided.
	 * 
	 * @cfg {HTMLElement/jQuery/ui.Component} [anchor.element]
	 *   Synonym of `of` property, which may replace it where it makes more sense in calling code.
	 * 
	 * @cfg {String} [anchor.offset]
	 *   Adds these left-top values to the calculated position. Ex: "50 50" (left top). A single value
	 *   given in the string will apply to both left and top values.
	 * 
	 * @cfg {String} [anchor.collision]
	 *   When the positioned element overflows the window in some direction, move it to an alternative position. Similar to `my` and `at`, 
	 *   this accepts a single value or a pair for horizontal/vertical, eg. "flip", "fit", "fit flip", "fit none". Defaults to 'flip'.
	 *   
	 *   - __flip__: (the default) to the opposite side and the collision detection is run again to see if it will fit. If it won't fit in either position, the center option should be used as a fall back.
	 *   - __fit__: so the element keeps in the desired direction, but is re-positioned so it fits.
	 *   - __none__: do not do collision detection.
