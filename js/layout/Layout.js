	/**
	 * @abstract 
	 * @class ui.layout.Layout
	 * @extends ui.util.Observable
	 * 
	 * Base class Layout that defines the public interface of all Layout subclasses. Layouts are stateful strategy objects 
	 * that are used by {@link ui.Container ui.Containers} to implement how their child items are displayed. Because of their 
	 * stateful nature, the same layout may not be used by multiple {@link ui.Container ui.Containers}.
	 * 
	 * The default layout that is used for a {@link ui.Container Container} is the {@link ui.layout.Auto}, 
	 * which simply renders each child component directly into the {@link ui.Container ui.Container's} 
	 * {@link ui.Component#getContentTarget content target element}, and does no further sizing or formatting.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ## Building a Layout
	 * 
	 * Layout subclasses should implement the {@link #onLayout} hook method to implement their layout routine.
	 * They should first call the superclass `onLayout` method, and then implement the code to perform the desired layout.
	 * Note the following items:
	 * 
	 * - {@link #onLayout} and {@link #afterLayout} will be executed each time the {@link #container container's} 
	 *   {@link ui.Container#doLayout} method is executed. This means that {@link #onLayout} and {@link #afterLayout}
	 *   may be called multiple times during the lifetime of the Layout, and this should be handled. Some layouts choose
	 *   to have completely separate "first run" and "update layout" methods.
	 * - Use the helper methods in this Layout class to {@link #renderComponent render} and {link #sizeComponent size}
	 *   child components of the {@link #container}. They take into account details of the Layout system, and sizing details
	 *   (such as accounting for child component padding/margin/border) that aren't handled elsewhere. See the 
	 *   {@link #renderComponent} and {@link #sizeComponent} methods for details.
	 * - Layouts should handle the case of the {@link #container} they are laying out having 0 child components, and it should
	 *   also handle the cases where child components are added, removed, or reordered. However, try not execute the
	 *   {@link #renderComponent} method (and thus the {@link ui.Component#render} method) when the component is already
	 *   rendered and in the correct position. This adds DOM overhead, and can cause some weird behavior such as having
	 *   {@link ui.formFields.TextField TextFields to lose focus if a layout runs that does this.
	 * - Browser window resize events should not be handled within the Layout. The top level {@link ui.Viewport} will
	 *   call its {@link ui.Container#doLayout doLayout} method to fix the layout automatically, on resize.
	 * 
	 * Layouts are required to manage any HTML elements that they create, and should clean up after themselves
	 * when they are done. This includes cleaning up old HTML elements when {@link #doLayout} (and therefore,
	 * {@link #onLayout}) is run again, and when the Layout is {@link #destroy destroyed}. Subclasses should
	 * implement the {@link #onDestroy} method to implement their clean up as part of the destruction process.
	 * Note that a layout may be destroyed by a {@link ui.Container} if another layout is set to it, and therefore
	 * it cannot be relied on that the Container will clean up any stray elements that a Layout has created.
	 *
	 * 
	 * @constructor
	 * @param {Object} config The configuration options for the Layout, specified in an object (hash).

		 * This method lazily renders the provided `component`. A call to the component's {@link ui.Component#render render}
		 * method will only be made if:
		 * 
		 * 1) The `component` is not yet {@link ui.Component#render rendered}.
		 * 2) The `component` is rendered, but not a child of the `$targetEl`. Calling {@link ui.Component#render render} here

		 * (see {@link ui.formFields.TextAreaField#autoGrow}). If a parent layout of the TextAreaField moves a component in the DOM,

		 *   by this method (if provided), to determine if the `component` needs to be moved (by way

		 *   the component is already in the correct position, or else no call to {@link ui.Component#render}
