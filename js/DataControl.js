 * that must be implemented by classes that it is mixed with. It also defines the {@link #datachange} event, for generalized handling of changes to
 * a DataControl's data. Subclasses are expected to call the {@link #onDataChange} method when they want this event to be fired.
 * 
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} config The configuration options for this Component, specified in an object (hash).
